# Snakegame.python
The code initializes pygame, sets up game window and objects, controls snake movement, handles fruit spawning, and manages scoring and game over conditions. It incorporates key event detection for snake direction, collision detection with fruit and walls, and snake growth logic. The game_over() function cleans up after game ends.
